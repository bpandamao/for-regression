    "for a regression tree, the value $\\mu_{j}$ of the terminal mode is assigned to a sample with $X={x_{1},x_{2},....x_{p}}$, so we can have $g(x;T,M)$ with T is the nodes and decision rules, M is the $\\mu$, and \n",

    "\n",
    "When every terminal node assignment depends on just a single component of  x, the sum-of-trees model reduces to a simple additive function, a sum of step functions of the individual components of x. m is the number of parameters, with how many trees, So how to set the m\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the choice of m\n",
    "a fast and robust option is to choose m=200,then maybe check if a couple of other values makes any difference, to look if the performance improve with the increased m\n",

    "A regularization prior\n",
    "Without such a regularizing influence, large tree components would overwhelm the rich structure,thereby limiting the advantages of the additive representation both in terms of function approximation and computation.\n",
